# 🧠 DEV_LOG_Majd_Zarai.md  
DYDON AI – Internship 2025 Submission

This development log outlines the architecture, design rationale, implementation process, and key technologies behind my solution for the DYDON AI Internship 2025 challenge.

---

## 📌 Objective

Design and implement a Python-based system that:
- Extracts text from `.pdf`, `.docx`, and `.xlsx` documents
- Applies OCR to scanned PDFs
- Is modular, readable, and production-ready
- Includes logging, error handling, and extensibility
- Optionally includes a frontend for user interaction

---

## 🧠 Solution Architecture

I structured the project around a **modular pipeline**, where each file type is handled by a dedicated extractor script under the `Majd_Zarai_text_extractor/` directory:

### 1. `pdf_handler.py`
- ✅ Extracts text from PDFs using `PyMuPDF` (fitz)
- ✅ If no machine-readable text exists, applies `pytesseract` OCR on each page using `pdf2image`
- ✅ Extracts embedded images using `fitz.get_page_images()` and stores them by page in a dedicated folder

### 2. `docx_handler.py`
- ✅ Parses paragraphs and tables using `python-docx`
- ✅ Ensures empty text is filtered out
- ✅ Optional support prepared for reading DOCX metadata

### 3. `excel_handler.py`
- ✅ Uses `openpyxl` to parse all sheets
- ✅ Cleans and formats rows with tab delimiters
- ✅ Skips empty rows for concise output

### 4. `extract_text_Majd_Zarai.py`
- ✅ CLI pipeline that:
  - Iterates over files in the `uploads/` folder
  - Delegates to the correct handler
  - Saves output `.txt` files with my name in the filename
  - Logs all actions and errors

## 🌐 Front-End – `majd_front.py`

To complement the CLI, I developed a clean and intuitive **Streamlit front-end** for real-time interaction.

### Features:
- 📂 Drag-and-drop file upload
- 📝 Live preview of extracted text
- 🖼️ Button to toggle and preview images (per-page thumbnails)
- 💾 Download button for extracted `.txt` results
- 🎨 Custom gradient background (red-to-white) and modern card styling
- ✅ Fully responsive layout and optimized UX

## 🏗️ Design Considerations

- **Modularity**: Each file type is handled in isolation for maintainability and testability.
- **Clarity**: All functions include docstrings and inline comments.
- **Logging**: All major actions and exceptions are logged to inform the user.
- **Extensibility**: New formats or NLP processing steps could be added with minimal changes.
- **Naming conventions**: Output files are saved as `majd_zarai_<filename>_cleaned.txt` per DYDON requirements.

## 📦 Folder Output Example

When a user uploads a file named `invoice.pdf`, this is what the output structure looks like:

text ```
extracted_texts/
├── majd_zarai_invoice_cleaned.txt
└── majd_extracted_images_from_pdf/
└── invoice_images/
├── page1_img1.png
├── page2_img2.png
└── ...
